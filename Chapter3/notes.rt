Java converts ints -> doubles automatically

Use a typecast to go from double to int

//  In python, we would use a builtin
double pi = 3.14159265;
int z = (int) pi;

// Access the sqrt static method from the Math class and pass
// the value 17.0 as the argument
Math.sqrt(17.0);


A class is a collection of related methods

When you call a method, you provide arguments.  The parameters
of the method signature are what holds the arguments.
